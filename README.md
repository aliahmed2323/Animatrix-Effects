## ⚠️ Prerequisites

> **[DoTween](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dotween-hotween-v2-27676)** is **required** — it is the backbone of this package. Make sure it is installed and initialized in your project before using Animatrix Effects.

## 📖 About

Animatrix Effects was built to increase the speed and efficiency of UI animation workflows, particularly for **mobile games**. Some design and animation choices are opinionated by nature — they're tailored to how mobile UI animations are typically structured and may not follow conventional approaches, but they get the job done fast.
